            <h2>PROJECT MANAGEMENT INTERNSHIP</h2>
            <p>
                Over the summers of 2022 and 2023 I worked with Gilmor Engineering limited, a contractor working 
                for the Federal Capital Development Authority in Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria. During my project 
                management internship, I worked closely with engineers, contractors, and supervisors on various stages 
                of highway construction projects. I gained hands-on experience in scheduling, budgeting, and on-site 
                coordination. My responsibilities included reviewing project plans, assisting in tracking progress, and 
                attending coordination meetings to ensure timely and cost-effective execution. I also contributed to 
                quality control efforts by conducting field inspections and verifying that construction activities met 
                design specifications and safety standards. This role gave me valuable exposure to the fast-paced and 
                collaborative environment of construction management. I learned how to navigate challenges such as 
                weather delays, subcontractor coordination, and material delivery timelines, all while maintaining 
                effective communication across different stakeholders. My internship not only strengthened my 
                technical skills but also enhanced my leadership, problem-solving, and organizational abilitiesâ€”preparing 
                me for future roles in civil engineering.

            <h2>ENGINEERING PEER MENTOR</h2>
            <p>
                As an engineering peer mentor, I supported first- and second-year engineering students by helping them 
                transition into the academic and social environment of the engineering program. I served as a resource 
                for course planning, study strategies, and navigating university life, drawing from my own experiences 
                to provide guidance and encouragement. Through regular one-on-one check-ins and group mentoring sessions, 
                I fostered a supportive space where students could ask questions, share concerns, and build confidence. I 
                also collaborated with faculty and staff to organize academic workshops and community-building events, 
                aiming to strengthen retention and engagement among underrepresented students in STEM. This role deepened 
                my communication and leadership skills while reinforcing my own understanding of core engineering concepts. 
                It was incredibly rewarding to witness the growth of my mentees and know that I played a part in their academic 
                journeys. Mentoring taught me the value of empathy, patience, and the impact of peer support in engineering education.

            <h2>ASCE KIDS DAY</h2>
            <p>
                I volunteered at the ASCE Kids Day event hosted by my school's chapter, which introduced 3rd to 6th grade 
                students to various branches of civil engineering through fun, hands-on activities. The event featured rotating 
                stations focused on structural, transportation, environmental, and geotechnical engineering. I was stationed in the 
                transportation section, where I helped guide students through an interactive activity designed to teach them about 
                traffic flow, road safety, and basic transportation planning concepts. We used miniature road layouts and toy cars to 
                simulate different traffic scenarios, sparking conversations about signal timing, pedestrian safety, and congestion. 
                It was rewarding to see the kids so curious and excited about engineering, and to help them connect real-world problems 
                to simple solutions. Volunteering at this event strengthened my communication skills and reminded me how important 
                outreach is for inspiring future engineers. It also reinforced my own passion for transportation engineering and STEM education.
