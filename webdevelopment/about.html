    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>Hi, I'm Tehilla Gani-Yesufu, a Civil Engineering student with a <strong>passion</strong> for designing sustainable and impactful infrastructure.
    <br/>I'm currently pursuing my Civil Engineering degree with minors in Construction Management and Engineering Sustainability at the University of Missouri-Columbia.</p>
    
    <p>
        My work blends technical skill with a focus on real-world application. 
        <br/>This website serves as a curated portfolio of my academic projects, design experience, and fieldwork—from my project management internships to web-based design tools. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        At my school I am an <em>active</em> member of the National Society of 
        Black Engineers and the American Society of Civil Engineers and serve on the <em>executive board</em> of the African Students Association. 
        I'm also a part of the 2022 cohort of the National Science Foundation's S-Stem Scholars. Outside of my involvement on campus 
        I also serve in the larger Columbia area in several community service efforts. My goal is to build communities through resilient, 
        efficient design, and I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate, learn, and grow. As a result, I believe that every liitle thing I do
        -in my work and my personal life-is a contribution to a greater picture I can not see, so I put in a 100% all the time because 
        I know I am working on a piece of greatness.
    </p>
