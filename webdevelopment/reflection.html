    <section class="reflection-box">
        <p class="first-paragraph">My undergraduate journey as a Civil Engineering student at the University of Missouri-Columbia has been anything but linear
            —but it's in that complexity that I've found clarity about who I am and what I want to build in this world. When I first entered the program,
             I was driven by a love for design and the idea of creating something tangible and lasting. Over time, my goals matured. I began to see 
             engineering not just as a discipline of calculation and construction, but as a powerful tool to strengthen communities and address real-world 
             inequities. Balancing my civil engineering major with minors in Construction Management and Engineering Sustainability has allowed me to approach 
             problems with both technical rigor and long-term vision.
        </p>
        <p>Academically, this program has pushed me to grow in every direction: analytically, emotionally, and professionally. There have been high points, 
            like interning on real-world infrastructure projects and serving as a campus leader, and there have been low points—periods of illness, burnout, 
            academic struggle, and personal battles with mental health. There was a time I truly doubted myself and felt the weight of being far from home, 
            carrying expectations I didn't think I could meet. But facing those challenges has made me more resilient and self-aware. I've learned to advocate 
            for myself, to ask for help, and to redefine strength not as perfection, but as persistence. That growth, in and out of the classroom, has been just 
            as important as any technical skill I've gained.
        </p>
        <p>One of the most transformative parts of my undergrad experience has been my involvement in student organizations. From leading initiatives with the 
            African Students Association to participating in professional groups like ASCE and NSBE, I've found spaces where my voice matters—where I can both 
            learn from others and pour into my community. Representing Nigeria in cultural showcases and service efforts helped me stay grounded in who I am and 
            where I come from, even as I work toward a career that will likely take me far from home again. Those experiences have shaped not only my leadership 
            style, but also my passion for infrastructure that honors both people and place.
        </p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I'm excited to step into the field of construction and infrastructure design with a focus on sustainability and equity. I want to contribute 
            to projects that don't just meet technical standards but uplift communities—especially those that have been historically underserved. Whether it's working 
            on resilient urban development, accessible transportation systems, or green infrastructure, I want to be part of the generation of engineers that prioritizes 
            both innovation and impact. My ultimate goal is to build a career that blends design, policy, and advocacy—because I believe engineering, at its best, should 
            serve humanity. This undergraduate experience has not been easy, but it's given me the direction, conviction, and confidence I'll need to build the future I believe in.
