     Hi everyone, my name is Tehilla Gani-Yesufu. 
     I'm a junior here at the University of Missouri currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and two minors in construction management and engineering sustainability. 
     I do not have any proper web development skills, but I did take a beginner level Python class at Mizzou, and I enjoyed it a lot. 
     I hope at the end of the course I can create a functional website and will have enough tools under my belt that I can take more advanced courses that will further my ability. 
     My favorite hobby is definitely reading, and my favorite genre is fantasy (send anything dragon related my way). In my free time I watch formula 1.
